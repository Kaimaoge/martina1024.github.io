## About Me

I am now a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Dr. Lijun Sun's group](https://lijunsun.github.io/) in the Department of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics of McGill University, supported by [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/). I received the Ph.D. degree in vehicle operation engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in Jun. 2019. 

I aim to develop novel machine learning frameworks that optimize the efficiency and safety of modern intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Today, all of our connected devices in the transportation system collect tremendous amounts of data at an unprecedented scale. Yesterday’s concepts and tools are insufficient to serve tomorrow’s data-driven transportation system. The key challenges include 1) big traffic data often demonstrate complex dependence structures in both spatial and temporal domains, and come in multiple resolutions. 2) The increasing deployment of autonomous & connected devices turns intelligent transportation system into a multi-agent system with multi-objective orientation. In order to fully harness the power of modern ITSs, my goal is to 1) develop newly supervised and unsupervised machine learning tools for capturing spatial and temporal dependencies, 2) making reliable predictions on both spatial and temporal domains, 3) establish new multi-agent and multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithms, and 4) achieving system-level control.} My primary research lies in the fundamental areas of machine learning, and with a strong emphasis on applications in ITSs.
